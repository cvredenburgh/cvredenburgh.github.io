Here, I will summarize enhancements to that work, including:</p><p>- Testing model architecture enhancements to improve performance<br>  - Organic token pruning methodologies<br>  - Relaxing tag entity-to-image region constraints<br>  - Wavelet-based transformers to better detect relevant patterns<br>- Techniques to assess the quality of the visual model's representations<br>- Leveraging the model to evaluate product concepts</p><p>ðŸš§ <em>In progress â€“ coming soon.</em></p></div>",
