                Thank you for visiting my site!
            </h1>
            <p>
                My site is currently under construction, but come back soon! This is a space where I share projects (mainly data science, neuroscience, cognitive science and blockchain-related), ideas, and links to other content I find interesting.  
                I am building a self-hosted site and I'll sharing a piece about building self-hosted sites with Ghost, in case others may want to do so! Very best regards, Chris
