            <p>
                My site is currently under construction, but come back soon! This is a space where I share projects, ideas, and links to other content I find worthy of attention (mainly data science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and blockchain-related).  
                I am building a self-hosted site with Ghost and I'll share an overview of that process, in case others may want to do so! Very best regards, Chris
