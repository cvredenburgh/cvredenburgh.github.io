                It's currently under construction, but come back soon. This is a space where I'll be sharing projects, ideas, and links to other content I find interesting.  This is a self-hosted site leveraging a Ghost package.  I'll be sharing a piece about building a self-hosted site with Ghost, in case others may want to do so! Best regards, Chris
