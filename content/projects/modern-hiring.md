title: Hiring is Active Investing: Reflecting on the Limits of Structured Interviews
description: Similar to active investing, a wide body of research (both academic and corporate) shows hiring managers rarely outperform the index (chance). Namely, case study evaluations, coding evaluation scores, and other highly structured interviews consistently show very poor predictability for later job performance. I explore the implications for both companies and applicants, and what productive interview cycles could instead focus on.
