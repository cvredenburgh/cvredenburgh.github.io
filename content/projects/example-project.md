# Example Project

This is an example project that demonstrates how to add new projects to your website by simply creating markdown files in the content/projects directory.

## Features

- Easy to add new projects
- Full Markdown support
- Automatic display on your projects page
- Control over project metadata

## How It Works

When you add a new markdown file to the content/projects directory, the website automatically detects it and displays it on your projects page. The metadata at the top (between the --- markers) provides information like the title, description, and tags.

```javascript
// Example code can be included too
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Images

You can also include images in your project descriptions:

## Next Steps

To add a new project, simply create a new .md file in the content/projects directory with similar metadata at the top.
