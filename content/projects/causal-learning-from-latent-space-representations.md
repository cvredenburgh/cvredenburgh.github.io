title: Causal Learning From Rich Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations
description: Investigating how rich latent representations from vision-language models (VLMs) can be leveraged for causal learning. In this case, we learn about how product features and design impact customer sentiment and responses.

# Causal Learning From Rich Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations

This project builds on prior work using rich VLM representations (e.g. CLIP) for product understanding. I explore how these embeddings can be used for causal modeling â€” through attribution analysis, latent mining, and targeted counterfactual generation.
