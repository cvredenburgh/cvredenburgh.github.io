title: Causal Learning From Rich Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations
description: Demonstrating how latent, fine-grained representations from vision-language models (VLMs) can be leveraged for causal learning. In this application, I manipulate product design representations to understand how design choices impact customer sentiment and responses.

# Causal Learning From Rich Vision Language Model (VLM) Representations

This project builds on prior work using rich VLM representations (e.g. CLIP) for product understanding. I explore how these embeddings can be used for causal modeling â€” through attribution analysis, latent mining, and targeted counterfactual generation.
