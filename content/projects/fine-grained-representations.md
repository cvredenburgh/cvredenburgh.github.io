# Building a Multimodal Product Concept Evaluation Model

This project built upon prior AI research leveraging specialized tag tokens to effectively drive contrastive learning to develop rich, detailed visual representations relevant to fashion consumers.  Here, I will summarize enhancements to that work, including:

- Testing model architecture enhancements to improve performance
  - Organic token pruning methodologies
  - Relaxing tag entity-to-image region constraints
  - Wavelet-based transformers to better detect relevant patterns
- Techniques to assess the quality of the visual model's representations
- Leveraging the model to evaluate product concepts
