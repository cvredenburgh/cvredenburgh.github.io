# Regional Contrastive Learning for Visual Product Concepts

This project builds on earlier research in multimodal product modeling. It explores ways to enhance multimodal representation quality for fashion products by refining contrastive learning methods, token alignment, and evaluating latent visual relevance.

- Testing model architecture enhancements to improve performance
  - Organic token pruning methodologies
  - Relaxing tag entity-to-image region constraints
  - Wavelet-based transformers to better detect relevant patterns
- Techniques to assess the quality of the visual model's representations
- Leveraging the model to evaluate product concepts
