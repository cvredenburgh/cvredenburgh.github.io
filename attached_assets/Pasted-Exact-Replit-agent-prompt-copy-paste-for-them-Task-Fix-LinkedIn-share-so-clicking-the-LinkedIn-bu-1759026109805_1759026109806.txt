Task: Fix LinkedIn share so clicking the LinkedIn button opens the LinkedIn composer with the article URL pre-filled.

Context:
- Current behavior: LinkedIn page opens but composer does not include the link.
- Tech: React SPA (uses React Router). Replit preview used for development.
- Desired: clicking "Share on LinkedIn" opens a new tab/window with the composer and the article URL correctly pre-filled.

Steps to implement & verify:
1. Replace any React Router <Link> or router-intercepted element used for LinkedIn with a plain <a> anchor:
   <a href={`https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=${encodeURIComponent(articleUrl)}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Share on LinkedIn</a>
   - Ensure server-side or client-side properly fills articleUrl (canonical URL).
2. If using a JS button, ensure window.open is called synchronously inside the click handler (no async/await before it).
   Example:
   const shareUrl = `https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=${encodeURIComponent(articleUrl)}`;
   window.open(shareUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
3. Add logging: console.log('shareUrl=', shareUrl) before opening.
4. Add a fallback UI: if window.open returns null (popup blocked), show a modal with the shareUrl so the user can copy it manually.
5. Add a test page route that renders a static anchor to:
   https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
   Verify clicking that link in both Replit preview and external browser opens LinkedIn composer with Google link. Document results.
6. Test the actual article URL by pasting the constructed shareUrl (from console) into browser address bar — verify composer includes the link.
7. If composer still does not include link for the real article URL:
   - Verify the article URL is publicly accessible (not behind auth).
   - Check robots.txt or server headers for blocks preventing LinkedIn from reading the page.
   - If server returns 403/401, fix hosting or make the page public for sharing.
8. Add Open Graph tags on article pages (og:title, og:description, og:image) for good LinkedIn previews — not required to prefill, but improves appearance.

Deliverable:
- Commit with changes and short PR description.
- A small verification log: console outputs for shareUrl and a screenshot showing the LinkedIn composer with the URL prefilled (from an external browser).
- If something cannot be reproduced in Replit preview, explain and confirm behavior in a real browser.

Notes:
- Do NOT attempt to programmatically post (LinkedIn API/OAuth is needed).
