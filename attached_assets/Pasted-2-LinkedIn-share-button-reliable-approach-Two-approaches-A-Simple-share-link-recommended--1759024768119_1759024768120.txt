2) LinkedIn share button — reliable approach

Two approaches:

A. Simple share link (recommended) — opens LinkedIn’s share dialog and pre-fills the article URL:

<!-- Use an anchor not JS window.open to avoid popup-blockers in some contexts -->
<a id="linkedin-share" 
   href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Flighting-article"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Share on LinkedIn
</a>


If you need to generate the URL programmatically:

function linkedinShareUrl(articleUrl) {
  return "https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=" + encodeURIComponent(articleUrl);
}

document.getElementById('linkedin-btn').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  // Ensure it's a direct user gesture so browser allows the new window
  const url = linkedinShareUrl(window.location.href);
  window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
});


Why this works

share-offsite is LinkedIn’s current public endpoint for opening their share dialog and pre-populating the URL. It will not set arbitrary post text in many browsers (that’s by LinkedIn policy), but the link will be prefilled into the share composer so the user sees it and can add text.

To post automatically without user interaction you must use the LinkedIn API (requires OAuth tokens and permissions). For most sites the share-offsite flow is the right UX.

Important: avoid older URL formats like https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=...&title=... — they sometimes still work but are less reliable and LinkedIn has changed behaviors historically.

Open Graph (OG) metadata:

To make the LinkedIn preview show title/description/image, make sure the article page includes OG tags:

<meta property="og:title" content="Article Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="Short description">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/article-slug">


If OG tags are missing, the share composer may not show a nice preview.
